# Surf_2_Volume

**Surf_2_Volume** is a new method for converting atlases from any CIFTI space to NIFTI space.

As an example, we demonstrate the conversion using the CIFTI file from the [Cole-Anticevic Brain-wide Network Partition](https://github.com/ColeLab/ColeAnticevicNetPartition).

We provide two preprocessed MNI152 templates at 2Ã—2Ã—2 mm resolution:

- `MNI152NLin6Asym`
- `MNI152NLin2009cAsym`

If you would like to use this method with a different atlas or MNI space, simply try our Docker image:
